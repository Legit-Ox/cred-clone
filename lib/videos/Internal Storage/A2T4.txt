Q.4 Create a Parent-Child relationship between two processes.

The Parent process prints:

(a) Parent(P) is having ID < P ID >
(b) ID of P’s child is < ChildP ID >

The child prints:
(c) Child is having ID < P ID >
(d) My Parent ID is < ParentP ID >

Make sure the order of statements is as follows:
A
C
D
B

Code 4 :


#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
    pid_t child_pid = fork(); // creation of the child process using the fork statement 
    if (child_pid == 0) {
        printf("Child is having ID %d\n",getpid());  // to get the process id of the current process
        printf("My Parent ID is %d\n",getppid());   // to get the process id of the parent process
    } else {
        printf("Parent(P) is having ID %d\n",getpid()); 
        wait(NULL);
        printf("ID of P’s child is %d\n",child_pid); 
    }
    return 0;
}
